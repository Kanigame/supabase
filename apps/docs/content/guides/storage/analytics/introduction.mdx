Supabase Storage supports **Analytics Buckets**, designed for analytical workflows on large datasets without impacting your main database.

Regular Supabase tables (Postgres) are optimized for powering your application, handling real-time, transactional operations with frequent inserts, updates, and deletes.

**Analytical workloads**, however, have different requirements: processing large volumes of historical data, running complex queries and aggregations, storing data cost-effectively, and avoiding interference with production traffic.

**Analytics Buckets** address these needs using [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/), an open-table format for managing large analytical datasets efficiently. They are well suited for data warehousing, business intelligence, periodically refreshed real-time analytics, historical data archiving, and complex queries over large datasets.

This separation makes it easier to build analytics pipelines and derive insights within Supabase, while keeping transactional and analytical workloads isolated.
